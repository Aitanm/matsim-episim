process to create a snz scenario

(0.) extract adult id set from adult population - only necessary for Berlin scenario
    (class ExtractPersonIdsToTxt)

1. filter and aggregate educational facilities of entire germany to use case area (by shape file, currently done by vsp)
    (class FilterEducFacilitiesForCertainArea)

2. filter germany events
        a. by event type (only ActivityStart, ActivityEnd, PersonEntersVehicle, PersonLeavesVehicle will remain)
        b. by adult id set
    AND

        c. change facilities in events such that only remaining facilities (see step 1) are visited
    (class FilterEvents)

3. filter germany adult population attributes file by adult-id-for-use-case-set and convert it to plans file format (containing no plans but only attributes)
    (class ConvertPersonAttributes)

4. filter germany school population (containing no plans) such that only children remain that have home id's which are also referenced by remaining adults
   also filter for children that have their home within the use case shape file..

   write out 2 files:
        (1) only school population with no plans
        (2) merge from (1) and step (3)
    (class CutSchoolPopulationFitting2UseCaseAdultPopulation)

    //TODO description of the step assigning districts is missing....

5. build plans for school population, (take step 4 (1) as input)

     !!! might be that you have to tune age classes for schools !!! (e.g. primary school in Berlin = 6 - 12 but primary school in Munich = 6 - 10)
    (class BuildSchoolPlans)

6. simulate school population and create events
    -> needs transit schedule and network file and vehicles file
    (RunMATSim)

7. filter output events from step 6 analogous to step 2
    (class FilterEvents)

8. merge events of school population simulation (step 7) and adults simulation (step 2)
    (command MergeEvents)

???. create episim input events [TODO should not be necessary any more? but keep for outside users..]
    (using prepare.DownSampleScenario)
    TODO migrate?

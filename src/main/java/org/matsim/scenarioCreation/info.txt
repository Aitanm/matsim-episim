process to create a snz scenario

(0.) extract adult id set from adult population - only necessary for Berlin scenario

1. filter and aggregate germany facilities (by shape file, currently done by vsp)
    (class FilterEducFacilitiesForCertainArea)
2. filter germany events by adult id set
    AND
    change facilities in events such that only remaining facilities (see step 1) are visited
    (class FilterEvents)
3. filter germany school population (containing no plans) such that only children remain that have home id's which are also referenced by remaining adults
    (looking up events file from step 3), then sample down to same sample size as adults
    (class CutSchoolPopulationFitting2UseCaseAdultPopulation)
4. build plans for school population
    (class BuildSchoolPlans)
5. simulate school population and create events
    -> needs transit schedule and network file
    (TODO create run class)
6. merge events of school population simulation (step 5) and adults simulation (step 2)
    (TODO create events merging class)
7. create episim input events
    (using prepare.DownSampleScenario)
    TODO migrate?

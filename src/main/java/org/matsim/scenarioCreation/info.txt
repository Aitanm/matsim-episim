process to create a snz scenario

(0.) extract adult id set from adult population - only necessary for Berlin scenario

1. filter germany events by adult id set
2. filter and aggregate germany facilities (by shape file, currenty done by vsp)
3. change facilities in events such that only remaining facilities (see step 2) are visited
4. filter germany school population (containing no plans) such that only children remain that have home id's which are also referenced by remaining adults
    (looking up events file from step 3), then sample down to same sample size as adults
5. build plans for school population
6. simulate school population and create events
    needs
7. merge events of school population simulation (step 7) and adults simulation (step 3)
8. create episim input events (using DownSampleScenario.java)
